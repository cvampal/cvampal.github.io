I am a PhD student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/) Department  at [IIT Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in). 
My supervisor is [Prof. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/index.html).

Before that, I was a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) in [VisDom](https://vinodkkurmi.github.io/dcl) Lab at IISER Bhopal.
Where I worked with [Dr. Vinod K Kurmi](https://vinodkkurmi.github.io/).
